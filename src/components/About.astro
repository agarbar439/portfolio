      <p>👋 Hi, I'm Antonio García</p>
      
      <p>I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer and System Administrator with a strong technical foundation and hands-on experience in both web development and IT infrastructure.</p>

      <p>✅ Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.<br>
✅ Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Python, PHP, and Node.js.<br>
✅ Databases: MySQL, SQL Server and MongoDB.<br>
✅ DevOps/SysAdmin: Docker, Git, Bash, PowerShell, Linux, Windows Server, AWS, Apache, DNS,
DHCP, FTP, SMTP, HTTP.<br>
✅ Extras: CI/CD Pipelines, Virtualization (VMware, VirtualBox), Network and Services Administration
</p>
<p>🔧 My background in system administration includes Linux servers, DNS management, and network troubleshooting, which gives me a holistic understanding of how web systems operate from the ground up.
</p>
<p>🌍 I completed an Erasmus+ internship in Germany, where I built interactive web interfaces to control lighting systems — combining front-end skills with real-world hardware interaction.
</p>
<p>🚀 I'm a fast learner, always curious, and eager to explore new technologies to improve my development workflow and bring greater value to the teams I work with.
</p>
<p>I'm open to relocation within Europe and excited to join a team where I can grow, contribute, and collaborate on innovative projects.
</p>
<p>👉 Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you'd like to connect or work together!
