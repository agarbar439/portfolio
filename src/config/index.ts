    üëã Hi, I'm Antonio Garc√≠a
üíª Junior Full Stack Developer and DevOps with experience in full-stack web development and application deployment.

üîπ During my internship, I developed more than 15 websites with WordPress, using Elementor and adding JavaScript functionalities for interactive features.

üîπ Among my personal projects, I developed a web app for inventory management with Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS3, including product/category management, stock control, protected zones, chat, and user authentication. The application is deployed on AWS EC2 and features continuous integration (CI/CD) for automated deployments.

üîπ I also have experience managing servers, including Windows Active Directory and Linux, web servers with Apache, and services like DNS, FTP, HTTP, SSH, and SMTP. This helps me deploy and maintain applications in real environments.

üåç Based in M√°laga, B2 English level, available to relocate in Europe. I aim to continue growing as a web developer, delivering efficient solutions, and contributing to development teams.
