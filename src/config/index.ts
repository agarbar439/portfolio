    üëã Hi, I'm Antonio Garc√≠a
I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer and System Administrator with a strong technical foundation and hands-on experience in both web development and IT infrastructure.

üíª I work with technologies like JavaScript, PHP, Express.js, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, and I'm familiar with tools like Docker, Git, Postman, and AWS.
üîß My background in system administration includes Linux servers, DNS management, and network troubleshooting, which gives me a holistic understanding of how web systems operate from the ground up.
üåç I completed an Erasmus+ internship in Germany, where I built interactive web interfaces to control lighting systems ‚Äî combining front-end skills with real-world hardware interaction.
üöÄ I'm a fast learner, always curious, and eager to explore new technologies to improve my development workflow and bring greater value to the teams I work with.

I'm open to relocation within Europe and excited to join a team where I can grow, contribute, and collaborate on innovative projects.

üëâ Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out if you'd like to connect or work together!
